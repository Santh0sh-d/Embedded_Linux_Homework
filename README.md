What are the frequencies, amplitues and shapes you see on the server outputs?
    
    - The Amplitude represents the maximum value of the signal.
      Server output data range shows -5.0 to 5.0. Max value is 5.0 and Min value is -5.0.
    - The Frequency is the number of oscillations (cycles) that occur in a time interval.
      Client receives data from server every 100ms (0.1 seconds) 
    -Server output resembles a sine wave.
